# ng-seed / js
This folder will contain your JavaScript files. Currently, it includes `app.js` which contains the code to wire up the Angular stuff for our basic seed app. 
  
As your app keeps growing, you can have multiple `.js` files each containing individual modules, or individual controllers or any structure you are comfortable with. It would also be wise to construct sub-folders in this folder once your project expands.
